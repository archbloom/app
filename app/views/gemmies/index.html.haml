        Welcome to RailsBump! üëã

      %p
        RailsBump lets you check your Ruby gems for compatibility with all major Rails versions. This is useful if you're planning to upgrade a Rails app to the next major version. You can either check an individual gem or a "lockfile" generated by
        = link_to "Bundler", "https://bundler.io/"
        (Gemfile.lock) containing all the gems of your Ruby project.
